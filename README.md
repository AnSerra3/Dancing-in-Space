# Dancing in Space
Here, you can see the details of our project for the robocup onstage competition. We have progammed 4 robots (1 spider, 2 medium and 1 bigger), who dance together.

Our performance is based on 2 pieces of music:"Also sprach Zarathustra" by Richard Strauss and "We will rock you" by Queen. The 4 robots will execute an engaging choreography, syncronized with each other by Lego Bluetooth.

We have also added a led strip that will accompany the whole choreography in time with the music. The lights will simulate constellations with a simple switch on-off...  We have therefore attached the LEDs behind a billboard that will be the background to the show. This playbill represents space, full of stars and planets.
